                                    <p>We recommend that no other bodywork is carried out during your treatment programme. This is to ensure the body is not overloaded with information or given differing theraputic information to deal with at the same time,
                                        which may reduce the overall success of your treatment.</p>
                                    <p>We suggest a course of 3 treatments are booked initially, a week apart. Your treatment plan is then reviewed during your third session. Some people start to feel an immediate change and short term (acute) injury is
                                        usually resolved in 3-4 treatments. Long standing (chronic) conditions may require more sessions, or ongoing treatment. Every "body" is however unique.</p>
                                    <p>At your first session, a full case history of past and present illnesses including accidents and injuries, and lifestyle history will be taken followed by a detailed description of any presenting conditions that may
                                        need treating. Please bring a full list of medications that you are currently taking. The Bowen Technique is not a substitute for medical advice and you should not stop any presecribed medication unless advised
                                        by your GP.</p>
                                    <p>Many people have follow up treatments every 6 weeks to 3 months for preventative and maintenance measures. Regular Bowen top-ups can help strengthen and balance the body, making it more able to deal with their environmental
                                        factors.

                                    <p>We do not diagnose our clients. A Bowen treatment will cover the whole body, thus allowing it to make the necessary changes to kick start the repair process and create healing.</p>
                                    <p>People often report feelings of heat or tingling in specific areas and go into a state of deep relaxation or sleep.</p>

                                    <p>After the therapist has done their moves, they leave the room for 2-5 minutes, before returning to do more. This allows Bowen to ask the body to recognise what has just happened and to make a decision as to whether
                                        the body needs to do something or to let go of it, without being on guard or distracted by someone elses presence.</p>
                                    <p>When treating anyone under 16, the parent or guardian will always remain in the room.</p>

                                    <p>Reactions to treatment are not uncommon, and actually demonstrate that the body is responding. It is vital that a client does not cease treatment in response to a strong reaction.</p>
                                    <p>Reactions include thirst, tiredness, hot or cold flushes, water retention, headaches, flu-like symptoms, increased dream activity, mood changes, emotional release, increase in original symptoms or re-surfacing of old
                                        injuries.

                                    <p>These are all positive signs that the healing process is working and these responses usually clear within a few days. Aftercare advice emphasises the importance of movement, the drinking of water and return for treatments.

                                    <p>The healing process continues long after your session has finished, which is also one of the reasons having other treatments are not recommended. (link to research proving this?)</p><br>
